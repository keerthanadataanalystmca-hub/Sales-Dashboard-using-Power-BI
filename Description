üìä Project Goal
The core objective is to deliver a Star Schema Data Model that is optimized for fast and flexible reporting. Key business demands include:

Sales Trend Analysis: Tracking sales over a two-year historical window.

Performance Comparison: Measuring current sales against the annual budget (for 2021).

Detailed Segmentation: Providing drill-down capabilities for Sales Representatives to analyze performance by individual Customer and Product.

üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture & Contents
The project is structured using a classic data warehousing approach, containing one fact table and three dimension tables, along with the SQL scripts used for ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Loading) logic.

File Type	File Name Example	Description
Fact Table	FACT_InternetSales.csv/.sql	The central table containing sales amounts, keys for dimensions, and order details.
Dimension Tables	DIM_Customers.csv/.sql	Provides customer context (Name, Gender, City) for segmentation.
DIM_Products.csv/.sql	Provides product context (Category, Sub-Category, Color, Size) for analysis.
DIM_Calendar.csv/.sql	A complete date dimension for granular time-based analysis (Year, Quarter, Month, Day).
Documentation	Business Demand Overview & User Stories.docx	The source document outlining the business requirements and acceptance criteria for the final Power BI dashboard.
